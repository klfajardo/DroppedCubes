# Dropped Cubes
### About Dropped Cubes

The essence of Dropped Cubes lies in its falling cubes and line-clearing mechanics. As cubes fall from the top, your task is to rotate and position them to complete lines on the grid. Clearing lines earns you points and creates more space for new cubes, extending your playtime.

### Personal Note <3

This is one of my first projects in Unity 3D. As a proactive learner and a beginner in game development, I initiated this project to practice and improve my skills. Your feedback is not just welcome but incredibly valuable to my learning process! :)
